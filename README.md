# 🎄 Advent of Code 🎄

This repo is a small project to hold all advent-of-code festivities as per [THIS](https://adventofcode.com/).

I will **try** to post all exercises for the 25 days in here.

## 💻 Tech 💻
This project is written in scala, there will be many better and worse ways of doing things but I am just playing around with things I wouldn't normally do/use day to day.

Tests can be ran with:

`sbt test`

or

`sbt ~test //for continuous testing on change to the source code`
